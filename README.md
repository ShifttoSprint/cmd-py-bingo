# cmd-py-bingo
 This is just a very Simple Bingo Game that can be played in a terminal or the Python IDLE.
 Ya know? Bingo? The game we used to play as kids with all the numbers?
 It's a very quick fix up and all the code could be done in a better way. But for now, I think this will be the end of the project :) .


**Fun Tip:** You can change the color theme of the game by playing around with the Terminal color scheme.
